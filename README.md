Silvio is a VPN-over-WebSocket implementation, based on the TUN interface. I am using it to connect all my devices to a single virtual network through a web service. According to [Wikpiedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Pellico), Silvio (Pellico) was an Italian writer, poet, dramatist and patriot active in the Italian unification. The street where I am currently living is named after him.
